        <h2>Task A: Uploading multiple files</h2>
        <p>Create a file upload / download application with the requirements specified below.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Please use <a href="https://github.com/CreativeDream/php-uploader">https://github.com/CreativeDream/php-uploader</a> as an upload class to complete it. Do not modify any code in class.uploader.php. If you want to make any changes, extend the upload class and override the function.</li>
            <li>Make the UI look nice and user friendly. You can use any framework, library, or write your own code.</li>
            <li>Users can only upload PHP, CSS, JavaScript and HTML file. <b>File size must be between 1 KB and 1MB</b> and can be verified before or after uploading.</li>
            <li>The user must to be able to <b>edit file names for each file before uploading</b>. The physical name of the uploaded file on the server should be the edited name.</li>
            <li>The user must be able to <b>see the original and edited file names</b> after submitting. The user can download these files. The downloaded file name should be <b>original file name + underscore + edited file name +underscore + downloaded date and time + extension</b>. (You can use cookies, sessions, files or variables for storing original file name)</li>

        <h2>Task B: Write a PHP function to achieve the following requirements</h2>
        <p>The function can accept a numeric parameter N. Then start calculating N, N*2, N*3, and so on. Keep track of which digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9) have appeared in the calculation. Once each of the ten digits has been calculated at least once, the function will return the last calculated number. If it has not been obtained all digits after 100 calculations, return False.</p>
        <br>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <br>
        <p>N	 = 12345, now you have 1 2 3 4 5</p>
        <p>N*2	 = 24690, now you have 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 9</p>
        <p>N*3	 = 37035, now you have 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 9</p>
        <p>N*4	 = 49380, now you have 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9</p>
        <p>Then return 49380</p>

        <h2>Bonus Task:</h2>
        <p>You work in a zoo and your job is feeding monkeys with Bananas and Apples. The zoo has an unlimited number of identical Monkeys, and each monkey can eat any number of Bananas and Apples at a time. You are given Bananas and Apples and need to distribute them among the monkeys. You want to feed as many monkeys as possible. However, <b>NO two monkeys can eat the same amount of Bananas and Apples at a time. ALL bananas and apples should be distributed</b>.</p>
        <p>What is the largest number of monkeys that you can feed by given number of Bananas and Apples?</p>
        <br>
        <p>For example, </p>
        <p>If you have 2 Bananas and 0 Apples, the only possible strategy is to give both Bananas to one monkey. </p>
        <p>If you have 4 Bananas and 5 Apples, one optimal strategy is to have:</p>
        <p>	   One monkey with 1 Banana</p>
        <p>    One monkey with 2 Bananas</p>
        <p>    One monkey with 1 Apple</p>
        <p>    One monkey with 3 Apples</p>
        <p>    One monkey with 1 Banana and 1 Apple</p>
        <p>You need to write a function that takes two parameters, number of Bananas and Apples, and returns the largest number of monkeys that can be fed.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Limits:</p>
        <p>Banana + Apple > 1;</p>
        <p>0 <= Banana <= 20</p>
        <p>0 <= Apple <= 20</p>
